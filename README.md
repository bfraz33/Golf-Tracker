# Golf-Tracker
In this project I created an app to keep track of me and my friends golf data for our golf league (we are novices at best). My goal here was to create an app to work on my database designing, I ended spending more time learning more python and different libraries for it. I also Inadvertently learned Dax while I was creating this. I put in our score card every Friday/Saturday and I have this exe on my task schedular to run every Sunday night, updates my power bi chart automatically. This was one my tougher projects on the python side and my numbers needed to be exact so that's where DAX in my power bi came in handy. I will add extra data throughout the months, but I am content with what I currently have. Thought I'd share with you all. Thanks!
